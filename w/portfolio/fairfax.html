<p>Fairfax had outsourced development of their community newspapers website to a company which had built a custom system which was plagued with issues. 7 months of development, large sums of money and developers exiting the project.</p>
<p>I was brought in too investigate how to make it work.....though after working with it for a short period of time and realizing just how poorly made it was.... I recommended to replace it with an upcoming &quot;Umbraco&quot; CMS, while there was initial resistance, deadlines were looming and they needed something to work fast, so they started implementing Umbraco, and in 4 weeks, they had a website up with about 80% functionality of what they had spent 7 months prior.</p>
