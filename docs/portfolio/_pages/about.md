Built many web solutions throughout the entire development lifecycle for 2 decades. Architected solutions for various companies, written technical documentation, along with full development, I have lots of time clocked up on both front end and back end development, and remain up to date.

I have made technical decisions for website solutions for web agencies, digital advertising companies, created websites from scratch with php, c# .net along with database design, and implemented several content management systems. From clients analysis to architectural concerns, wireframing, to server coding, and frontend markup and javascript.
