            Applying Umbraco CMS for Lots of Content

            &lt;p&gt;May 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfax had outsourced development of their community newspapers website to a company which had built a custom system which was plagued with issues. 7 months of development, large sums of money and developers exiting the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was brought in too investigate how to make it work.....though after working with it for a short period of time and realizing just how poorly made it was.... I recommended to replace it with an upcoming &amp;quot;Umbraco&amp;quot; CMS, while there was initial resistance, deadlines were looming and they needed something to work fast, so they started implementing Umbraco, and in 4 weeks, they had a website up with about 80% functionality of what they had spent 7 months prior.&lt;/p&gt;
