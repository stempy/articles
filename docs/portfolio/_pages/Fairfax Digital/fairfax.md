May 2008

Fairfax had outsourced development of their community newspapers website to a company which had built a custom system which was plagued with issues. 7 months of development, large sums of money and developers exiting the project.

I was brought in too investigate how to make it work.....though after working with it for a short period of time and realizing just how poorly made it was.... I recommended to replace it with an upcoming "Umbraco" CMS, while there was initial resistance, deadlines were looming and they needed something to work fast, so they started implementing Umbraco, and in 4 weeks, they had a website up with about 80% functionality of what they had spent 7 months prior.
