            <p>Jun 2006 - 2010 - 4 years<br>
Emstream<br>
Sydney, Australia<br>
<hr></p>
<p>I was contracted to develop a desktop music scheduling and playback application to be used in venues such as hotels,restaurants. The application ran 24/7 in various venues in Australia. Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>There were multiple zones of music in each venue such as the lobby, restaurant, and other areas. Each zone could be indiviudally controlled with scheduled, or on-demand playlists, and changed on the fly as needed.... with querying, filtering of songs by tempo, genre, custom Emstream catalog classifications.</p>
<p>I consulted with the manager and CEO to determine their requirements, and built the initial application over a 6 to 12 month period. The majority of this development was done remotely with the occassional on-site visit to discuss technical challenges or changes.</p>
<p>After the application was launched I maintained it over a period of several years for fixes, updates and additions.</p>
<p>Initially constructed in Visual Basic 6 due to limitations with connection to a required third party COM+ component. Everything was constructed in a modular design in order to be able to maintain it well after its deployment, this was a design goal from the outset. I then recreated the core components in C# Winforms, and later WPF.</p>
<p>This was a wonderful challenge, as I was the sole developer on this project, it was complex due to interactions with third-party components that had limitations. Theming Engines, COM+, VB6</p>
